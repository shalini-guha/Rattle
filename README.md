# Rattle

Created as final year project in partial completion of Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata.

Rattle is an encrypted instant-messaging client that employs a bitwise symmetric algorithm described in Roy, Re, De, Guha et al, *"RASS- A concurrency based bitwise symmetric key cryptographic algorithm", 2016 IEEE 7th Annual Ubiquitous Computing, Electronics & Mobile Communication Conference (UEMCON) [https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON.2016.7777842]* (with keys exchanged via Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Technique) and further secured by LSB steganography. Encryption and decryption are performed client-side and only encrypted messages are transmitted over Googleâ€™s Firebase Cloud Messaging platform.
